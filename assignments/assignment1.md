### Top 3 Domains
1. **Early Financial Literacy**<br>
I’ve personally experienced the frustration of messy coordination in student groups and study sessions. Between juggling Google Docs, timelines, and spreadsheets, it’s easy to lose track of tasks, resources, and progress. I’m interested in creating a tool that brings structure to these workflows, avoiding redundant research or work and streamlining projects.
2. **Personal Finance for Young Adults**
Managing money is a challenge for many students, especially when it comes to balancing small, daily expenses on a larger scope/timeframe or learning to invest. I’m interested in designing a tool that explains financial tools and searches for the "best" picks for a user's specific needs. This domain appeals to me because making financial literacy accessible and engaging for young adults has real, measurable impact, reducing financial stress while building good habits for the future.
3. **Academic Paper Discovery & Summarization**
Researching topics efficiently can be extremely time-consuming, particularly when searching for relevant academic papers and trying to understand key ideas quickly. I’m interested in building a tool that not only finds relevant papers but also summarizes and visualizes their connections, recommending readings and helping users navigate literature more effectively. This appeals to me as it's been a problem I've experienced when I first start doing deeper research into a topic.
