### Top 3 Domains
1. **Student Groups & Club Coordination**<br>
I’ve personally experienced the frustration of messy coordination in student groups and study sessions. Between juggling Google Docs, timelines, and spreadsheets, it’s easy to lose track of tasks, resources, and progress. I’m interested in creating a tool that brings structure to these workflows, avoiding redundant research or work and streamlining projects.
2. **Early Financial Literacy**<br>
Managing money is a challenge for many students, especially when it comes to balancing small, daily expenses on a larger scope/timeframe or learning to invest. I’m interested in designing a tool that explains financial tools and searches for the "best" picks for a user's specific needs. This domain appeals to me because making financial literacy accessible and engaging for young adults has real, measurable impact, reducing financial stress while building good habits for the future.
3. **Academic Paper Discovery & Summarization**<br>
Researching topics efficiently can be extremely time-consuming, particularly when searching for relevant academic papers and trying to understand key ideas quickly. I’m interested in building a tool that not only finds relevant papers but also summarizes and visualizes their connections, recommending readings and helping users navigate literature more effectively. This appeals to me as it's been a problem I've experienced when I first start doing deeper research into a topic.

## Problems
1. **Student Groups & Club Coordination**<br>
- Lost Tasks & Deadlines: Group members forget or duplicate tasks due to scattered communication.
  - Included: Tasks fall through the cracks because members communicate on multiple platforms. This problem is solvable with software, and it naturally supports a dynamic, state-focused app (task assignment, progress tracking, notifications).
- Inefficient Study Collaboration: Study groups struggle to coordinate sessions and share resources and knowledge effectively.
  - Excluded: Related to Lost Tasks & Deadlines, and is partially addressed by solving task management.
- Lack of Knowledge Retention: Important discussions and materials are scattered and difficult to reference later.
  - Excluded: Hard to scope. Requires saving large amounts of content and tracking user engagement.
2. **Early Financial Literacy**<br>
- Difficulty Tracking Spending: Students lose track of where their money goes, leading to overspending.
   - Included: Many students fail to track small daily expenses. This problem is widespread, directly impacts the target users, and is feasible to address with a simple dynamic app (transaction logging, categorization, summaries). I included it because it has measurable impact and is easy to prototype with mock or real data.
- Poor Savings Habits: Many young adults fail to save consistently or plan for short-term financial goals.
   - Excluded: verlaps with tracking spending; saving goals can be built later as a feature.
- Understanding Financial Concepts: Young adults struggle to learn basic financial literacy (budgeting, investing, debt management), as well as more refined financial tools (CDs, mutual funds, bonds).
   - Excluded: Valuable, but may require more educational content or complex external integration than I am prepared for.
3. **Academic Paper Discovery & Summarization**<br>
- Time-Consuming Literature Search: Students spend hours sifting through papers to find relevant ones.
   - Included: Finding relevant papers is a major bottleneck in research. Solving this helps both productivity and understanding, and is feasible through APIs and summarization. I included it because it’s clearly defined, widely applicable, and allows for measurable user impact (time saved).
- Difficulty Understanding Papers: Skimming abstracts is inefficient and key ideas may be missed. Even if the content they need is there, papers written not considering for more novice readers may be confusing.
   - Excluded: Could be added as a later feature (summarization), but the primary problem is discovering papers first.
- Tracking Connections: Students can’t easily see how papers relate (citations, shared concepts).
  - Excluded: Interesting but may be too complex for the first app iteration. Visualization is a nice addition, but is secondary to the core search problem.
