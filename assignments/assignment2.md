# Problem Statement: Student Groups & Club Coordination

## Problem Domain: Student Groups & Club Coordination
Student groups, clubs, and project teams rely on shared communication and task management to complete projects, organize events, and meet deadlines. However, coordination is often messy — tasks are spread across multiple platforms, deadlines are unclear, and work falls through the cracks. I care about this domain because I’ve personally experienced the stress of lost tasks and redundant work while working on class projects and student organizations. A well-designed tool could help students spend less time managing logistics and more time doing meaningful work.

## Key Problem: Lost Tasks & Deadlines
Group members often forget or duplicate tasks because communication is scattered across multiple channels (email, messaging apps, docs, etc.). This leads to missed deadlines, rushed work, and a general sense of disorganization and stress. A focused software solution for task assignment, progress tracking, and deadline reminders could provide a clear, shared view of what needs to be done and when.

## Stakeholders
- **Students (Direct Users):** Work on assigned tasks and rely on clear coordination to stay on track.
- **Club Leaders / Project Managers (Direct Users):** Organize tasks, assign responsibilities, and monitor progress.
- **Professors / TAs (Indirect Users):** Oversee group projects and may be affected by poor coordination through reduced project quality or increased administrative burden.

## Evidence and Comparables

### Evidence
1. **Group Work Challenges:** Research shows that students often criticize group work due to issues like unequal participation and missed deadlines, confirming the impact of poor coordination. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6234829/))
2. **Student Syndrome:** Studies on procrastination reveal that students delay work until deadlines approach, increasing the risk of last-minute rushes and missed tasks. ([Solving Procrastination](https://solvingprocrastination.com/student-syndrome))
3. **Impact of Deadlines on Productivity:** Evidence shows that clear, well-communicated deadlines can boost motivation and task completion rates among students. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10728329))

### Comparables
1. **Slack:** A communication platform that enables collaboration but lacks integrated task tracking and academic context.
2. **Notion:** Offers customizable workspaces for tasks and notes but requires significant setup and may overwhelm casual student users.
3. **Trello:** Provides task management boards but is not tailored for academic workflows or integrated with student group needs.
